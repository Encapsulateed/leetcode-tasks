Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 10
Explanation: The 10 incremovable subarrays are: [1], [2], [3], [4], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,2,3], [2,3,4], and [1,2,3,4], because on removing any one of these subarrays nums becomes strictly increasing. Note that you cannot select an empty subarray.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,5,7,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 incremovable subarrays are: [5], [6], [5,7], [6,5], [5,7,8], [6,5,7] and [6,5,7,8].
It can be shown that there are only 7 incremovable subarrays in nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [8,7,6,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 incremovable subarrays are: [8,7,6], [7,6,6], and [8,7,6,6]. Note that [8,7] is not an incremovable subarray because after removing [8,7] nums becomes [6,6], which is sorted in ascending order but not strictly increasing.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50
